# Survival Demo Project
A sandbox 3D type of project, where I implement different survival game features to improve my Unity skillset. My goal is to train to write better and cleaner code by creating extensible systems for different features. I am mainly using free assets provided by the Unity Asset Store, but I also wanted to learn other aspects of gamedev like 3D design and animations, therefore some assets are my own and are made with Blender.

## Features
The list of features that I would like to implement or are already implemented, in no particular order:
- First Person View/Controls
- Third Person View/Controls
- Smooth and fluid player movement
- Item system
- Inventory system
- Player stats like Hunger and Thirst
- In-depth Health system (eg. Project Zomboid, DayZ)
- Day/Night cycle
- Interactable objects (eg. Doors, Chests, Ladders etc.)
- Weapons
